# cmb-foreground-modeling
Computational modeling of the CMB blackbody spectrum with galactic synchrotron and thermal dust foreground components to study frequency-dependent contamination in observational cosmology.
# Overview
This project simulates the spectral intensity of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and incorporates dominant galactic foreground components:
- Synchrotron emission (power-law spectrum)
- Thermal dust emission (modified blackbody)
The goal is to analyze how different emission mechanisms dominate at different microwave frequencies and to understand challenges in CMB signal extraction.
